# Welcome to my Github 💡
Hello, my name is Felipe.
I am an electrical engineer with experience in power electronics, signal processing and control systems.
I have a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. My thesis was on the development of hybrid dc-dc converters for LED lighting with visible light communication capabilities.

# About myself 
I was born in the south region of Brazil, where I completed all my academic degrees in the Federal University of Santa Maria. Nowadays, I am currently living in Spain.

As an electrical engineer, I am always curious about how the areas of engineering are intertwined. Hence, during my academic carreer, I decided to follow a more generic path in order to develop a strong skillset of mathematics, physics and systems.

I pursued both my master and my PhD degrees in power electronics, with emphasis in LED drivers and visible light communications. It provided me with a research field full of interdisciplinary challenges, where I could put my mathematical skills to the test. From communications theory to control systems, from analog electronics to digital signal processing, I was able to work with several technologies and theories that enabled me doing the things that I do now.

Nowadays, I focus my efforts as a **solutions architect** for software applications turned for the power sector, merging machine learning, power systems and signal processing all together to enhance grid visibility and efficiency.

Finally, this Github is meant to be a profile where I can show you some of my works in my fields of interest.
