# Welcome to my Github 💡
Hello, my name is Felipe.
I am an electrical engineer with experience in power electronics, signal processing and control systems.
I have a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. My thesis was on the development of hybrid dc-dc converters for LED lighting with visible light communication capabilities.

# About myself 🇧🇷
I was born in the south region of Brazil, where I completed all my academic degrees in the Federal University of Santa Maria. Nowadays, I am currently living in Spain 🇪🇸.

As an electrical engineer, I am always curious about how the areas of engineering are intertwined. Hence, during my academic carreer, I decided to follow a more generic path in order to develop a strong skillset of mathematics, physics and systems.

I pursued both my master and my PhD degrees in power electronics, with emphasis in LED drivers and visible light communications. It provided me with a research field full of interdisciplinary challenges, where I could put my mathematical skills to the test. From communications theory to control systems, from analog electronics to digital signal processing, I was able to work with several technologies and theories that enabled me doing the things that I do now.

Thus, this Github is meant to be a profile where I can show you some of my works in my fields of interest.
